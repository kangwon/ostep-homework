1. Run process-run.py with the following flags: `-l 5:100,5:100`. What should the CPU utilization be (e.g., the percent of time the CPU is in use?) Why do you know this? Use the -c and -p flags to see if you were right.

CPU is always busy because there is no I/O task.

```
$ ./process-run.py -l 5:100,5:100 -c -p
Time    PID: 0    PID: 1       CPU       IOs
  1    RUN:cpu     READY         1
  2    RUN:cpu     READY         1
  3    RUN:cpu     READY         1
  4    RUN:cpu     READY         1
  5    RUN:cpu     READY         1
  6       DONE   RUN:cpu         1
  7       DONE   RUN:cpu         1
  8       DONE   RUN:cpu         1
  9       DONE   RUN:cpu         1
 10       DONE   RUN:cpu         1

Stats: Total Time 10
Stats: CPU Busy 10 (100.00%)
Stats: IO Busy  0 (0.00%)
```



2. Now run with these flags: `./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0`. These flags specify one process with 4 instructions (all to use the CPU), and one that simply issues an I/O and waits for it to be done. How long does it take to complete both processes? Use -c and -p to find out if you were right.

It takes 9 time; 4 CPU + 5 waiting time

```
$ ./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0 -c -p
Time    PID: 0    PID: 1       CPU       IOs
  1    RUN:cpu     READY         1
  2    RUN:cpu     READY         1
  3    RUN:cpu     READY         1
  4    RUN:cpu     READY         1
  5       DONE    RUN:io         1
  6       DONE   WAITING                   1
  7       DONE   WAITING                   1
  8       DONE   WAITING                   1
  9       DONE   WAITING                   1
 10*      DONE      DONE

Stats: Total Time 10
Stats: CPU Busy 5 (50.00%)
Stats: IO Busy  4 (40.00%)
```



3. Switch the order of the processes: `-l 1:0,4:100`. What happens now? Does switching the order matter? Why? (As always, use -c and -p to see if you were right)

After switching, CPU runs when waiting the I/O.

```
$ ./process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -c -p
Time    PID: 0    PID: 1       CPU       IOs
  1     RUN:io     READY         1
  2    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
  3    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
  4    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
  5    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
  6*      DONE      DONE

Stats: Total Time 6
Stats: CPU Busy 5 (83.33%)
Stats: IO Busy  4 (66.67%)
```



4. Weâ€™ll now explore some of the other flags. One important flag is -S, which determines how the system reacts when a process issues an I/O. With the flag set to SWITCH_ON_END, the system will NOT switch to another process while one is doing I/O, instead waiting until the process is completely finished. What happens when you run the following two processes (`-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END`), one doing I/O and the other doing CPU work?

No. The total time becomes 9.

```
$ ./process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END -p
Time    PID: 0    PID: 1       CPU       IOs
  1     RUN:io     READY         1
  2    WAITING     READY                   1
  3    WAITING     READY                   1
  4    WAITING     READY                   1
  5    WAITING     READY                   1
  6*      DONE   RUN:cpu         1
  7       DONE   RUN:cpu         1
  8       DONE   RUN:cpu         1
  9       DONE   RUN:cpu         1

Stats: Total Time 9
Stats: CPU Busy 5 (55.56%)
Stats: IO Busy  4 (44.44%)
```



5. Now, run the same processes, but with the switching behavior set to switch to another process whenever one is WAITING for I/O (`-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_IO`). What happens now? Use -c and -p to confirm that you are right.

Same with the question 3.

```
$ ./process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_IO -p
Time    PID: 0    PID: 1       CPU       IOs
  1     RUN:io     READY         1
  2    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
  3    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
  4    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
  5    WAITING   RUN:cpu         1         1
  6*      DONE      DONE

Stats: Total Time 6
Stats: CPU Busy 5 (83.33%)
Stats: IO Busy  4 (66.67%)
```



6. One other important behavior is what to do when an I/O completes. With `-I IO_RUN_LATER`, when an I/O completes, the process that issued it is not necessarily run right away; rather, whatever was running at the time keeps running. What happens when you run this combination of processes? (Run `./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -I IO_RUN_LATER -c -p`) Are system resources being effectively utilized?

No. It can be reduced 8 time if the I/O job is done while the CPU is running.

```
$ ./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -I IO_RUN_LATER -c -p
Time    PID: 0    PID: 1    PID: 2    PID: 3       CPU       IOs

7. Now run the same processes, but with `-I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` set, which immediately runs the process that issued the I/O. How does this behavior differ? Why might running a process that just completed an I/O again be a good idea?

Because the `IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` option minimizes the chance to wait I/O without CPU runiing.

```
$ ./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE -c -p

Time    PID: 0    PID: 1    PID: 2    PID: 3       CPU       IOs

8. Now run with some randomly generated processes: `-s 1 -l 3:50,3:50` or `-s 2 -l 3:50,3:50` or `-s 3 -l 3:50,3:50`. See if you can predict how the trace will turn out. What happens when you use the flag `-I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` vs. `-I IO_RUN_LATER`? What happens when you use `-S SWITCH_ON_IO` vs. `-S SWITCH_ON_END`?

The IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE, SWITCH_ON_IO pair is always the most efficient.
